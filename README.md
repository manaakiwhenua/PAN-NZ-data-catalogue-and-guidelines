## PAN-NZ Data Improvement

Welcome to the PAN-NZ data improvement page. 

This site provides resources that outline what is required for a protected area
dataset to be included in the PAN-NZ national protected area layer.

All information is stored in this GitHub repository and is also presented as a
GitHub Pages site to support easier navigation.

The dataset catalogues are managed as .csv files found in [_data](_data) (as
opposed to large markdown tables in the document it self) to allow for
straightforward editing and ongoing updates.

You can browse the live site at:

Thank you for contributing to this important data layer that supports a national
understanding of protected areas across Aotearoa New Zealand.
