## PAN-NZ Data Improvement

Welcome to the PAN-NZ data improvement page. 

This site provides resources that outline what is required for a protected area dataset to be included in the PAN-NZ national protected area layer.

All information is stored in this GitHub repository and is also presented as a GitHub Pages site to support easier navigation and contribution.

The dataset catalogues are managed as .csv files to allow for straightforward editing and ongoing updates. This format also enables better visibility of what source datasets exist, and what may be missing or incomplete.

You can browse the live site at:

Thank you for contributing to this important data layer that supports a national understanding of protected areas across Aotearoa New Zealand.
