Unique “type” values are: COVENANT & MANAGEMENT_AGREEMENT & PPL_AGREEMENT & KAWENATA. While the ”type” PPL_AGREEMENT (Section 76 of the Reserves Act 1977) has a one to one mapping to legislation, the other types do not and thus a relationship between type and legislation can not be established. At best the following one:many mappings are infered: (COVENANT: ""Section 22 Queen Elizabeth the Second National Trust Act 1977"" & ""Section 27 of the Conservation Act 1987"" & ""conservation covenant under Section 77 of the Reserves Act 1977""), (MANAGEMENT_AGREEMENT: ""A management agreement for conservation purposes under Section 29 of the Conservation Act 1987"" & ""A management agreement for conservation purposes under Section 38 of the Reserves Act 1977"") & (KAWENATA: ""A Maori reservation for natural, historic, or cultural conservation purposes under Sections 338 to 341 of the Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993 (Maori Land Act 1993)"")"
