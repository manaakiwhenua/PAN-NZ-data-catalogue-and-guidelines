to the catalogue data (e.g., [/_data/Parks_and_Reserves.csv](/_data/Parks_and_Reserves.csv))
or guidelines via (TODO// fix link once merged to `main`) [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

This can be done by:

1. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/manaakiwhenua/PANNZ-source-data)
2. Edit the relevant CSV file in `_data/` (These csv files are served to the data catalogues and 
   thus all edits should be made here.
3. Submit a Pull Request with a summary of your changes

We'll review and follow up with any clarifications before merging.
