The PAN-NZ data catalogues provide an inventory of known datasets 
that describe protected areas across Aotearoa New Zealand. These catalogues 
serve two key purposes:
* **Visibility:** Help users discover what protected area datasets already exist. This not only underpins 
  the compilation of the PAN-NZ national spatial layer, but also supports others discover and access protected area datasources. 
* **Data Improvement:** The Catalogues form the foundation for improving the national dataset by 
  highlighting known sources, identifying gaps or inconsistencies, and showing where further 
  engagement with data holders is needed.

By making this information transparent, we aim to strengthen collaboration, 
reduce duplication of effort, and guide efforts to ensure all protected areas are fairly 
and accurately represented in PAN-NZ. Each catalogue entry includes basic 
metadata about the dataset, such as custodian, access method, licensing, and steps required to 
integrate it in PAN-NZ.

The Catalogues have been broken into three subsets:
1. **[National Datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}/national_datasets_catalogue/index.html):** Protected Area datasets that cover all of New Zealand
2. **[Parks and Reserves]({{ site.baseurl }}/parks_and_reserves_catalogue/index.html):** Local Government datasets that include 
information of parks, such as Regional Parks.
1. **[SNAs (Significant Natural Areas)]({{ site.baseurl }}/sna_catalogue/index.html):** Datasets from Territorial Authorities that
   represent those areas as identified under Section 6(c) Resource Management Act 1991.
