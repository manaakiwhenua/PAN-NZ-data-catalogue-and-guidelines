The PAN-NZ data catalogues provide an inventory of known protected area source datasets 
that describe protected areas across Aotearoa New Zealand. These catalogues 
serve two key purposes:
* **Visibility:** They help users discover what protected area datasets already exist. This can support
  others discover and access protected area data. 
* **Data Improvement:** They form the foundation for improving the national dataset by highlighting known sources, identifying gaps or inconsistencies, and showing where further engagement with data holders is needed.

By making this information transparent, we aim to strengthen collaboration, 
reduce duplication, and guide efforts to ensure all protected areas are fairly 
and accurately represented in PAN-NZ. Each catalogue entry includes basic 
metadata about the dataset, such as custodian, access method, licensing, and steps required to 
integrate it in PAN-NZ.

The Catalogues have been broken into three subsets:
1. **[National Datasets]({{ site.baseurl }}/national_datasets_catalogue/index.html):** Protected Area datasets that cover all of New Zealand
2. **[Parks and Reserves]({{ site.baseurl }}/parks_and_reserves_catalogue/index.html):** Local Government datasets that include 
information of parks, such as Regional Parks.
3. **[SNAs (Significant Natural Areas)]({{ site.baseurl }}/sna_catalogue/index.html):** Datasets from Territorial Authorities that
   represent those areas as identified under Section 6(c) Resource Management Act 1991. 

Please visit each of the relevant data catalogue pages for more details on each sub-category including:
* The data sets we are aware of
* How each contributes to PAN-NZ
* limitation of each sub-category
