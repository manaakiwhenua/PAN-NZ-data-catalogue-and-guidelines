The PAN-NZ data catalogues provide an inventory of known protected area source datasets 
that describe protected areas across Aotearoa New Zealand. These catalogues 
serve two key purposes:
* **Visibility:** They help users discover what protected area datasets already exist. This can support
  others discover and access protected area data. 
* **Data Improvement:** They form the foundation for improving the national dataset by highlighting known sources, identifying gaps or inconsistencies, and showing where further engagement with data holders is needed.

By making this information transparent, we aim to strengthen collaboration, 
reduce duplication, and guide efforts to ensure all protected areas are fairly 
and accurately represented in PAN-NZ. Each catalogue entry includes basic 
metadata about the dataset, such as custodian, access method, licensing, and steps required to 
integrate it in PAN-NZ.
