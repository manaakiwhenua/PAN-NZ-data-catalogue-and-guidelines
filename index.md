## About PAN-NZ
PAN-NZ (Protected Areas Network – New Zealand) is a national initiative that improves how protected 
areas are documented, understood, and accessed through spatial data. Developed by Manaaki Whenua – 
Landcare Research, with funding from the Ministry for the Environment (MfE), PAN-NZ provides a 
consolidated national view of legal protections across Aotearoa New Zealand.

The programme aims to support better planning, monitoring, and reporting by:
* Consolidating spatial and descriptive protected data from central government, local government 
and non-profits organisation sources.
* Update the national protected areas information frequently 
* Classifying areas according to legal designations and IUCN categories. This allows the filtering and sorting
of protection areas based on the degree of protection afforded to supported bio-diversity. 
* Enabling discovery and interpretation of protected area data through a national catalogue of datasets.
* Engaging with data holders to improve the clarity, openness, and completeness of data.

By increasing transparency and improving data quality, PAN-NZ helps decision-makers, researchers, 
iwi/Māori, and the public better understand the extent and types of protected areas in New Zealand.


## Definition of Protected Area (for this stage of PAN-NZ)
For the purposes of PAN-NZ, a protected area is defined as a geographically defined area 
that is recognised and managed through legislation or other formal instruments to achieve 
long-term protection of natural, cultural, or recreational values. This broad definition 
ensures inclusive national coverage of the many ways protection is implemented across 
Aotearoa New Zealand.

However, users can refine the dataset to suit more specific definitions—such as the 
formal IUCN definition of a protected area—by applying filters like IUCN category, 
legal basis, or protection type.
