title: Protected Areas Network New Zealand (PAN-NZ) Data Improvement Project
# permalink: /

## Introduction 
The Ministry for the Environment (MfE) and Manaaki Whenua – Landcare Research (MWLR) are jointly 
advancing the Protected Areas Network of New Zealand (PAN-NZ), a national spatial dataset 
designed to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date view of 
protected areas across Aotearoa New Zealand.

Although the PAN-NZ database has existed for over a two decades, it has not been publicly released since 2007. Past 
compilations have been created on an ad hoc basis to support specific projects, limiting its accessibility and 
long-term utility. More importantly, previous versions have consistently lacked comprehensive coverage, especially of 
locally held protections.

This initiative seeks to address the key issues that have affected previous releases of PAN-NZ primarily those 
that have lead to the significant inefficiencies in combining the many source datasets required to create a national-level 
view of protected areas, and the persistent data gaps resulting from missing data and limitations of data sharing.


This initiative seeks to improve PAN-NZ to ensure regular updates, public availability, and an authoritative dataset by:
1. Developing data standards for protected areas.
2. Enabling discovery and interpretation of protected area data through the cataloging of protected area datasets.


The overarching goal is to enable an up-to-date national picture of protections to inform conservation 
planning, decision making, research, and progress tracking toward international 
commitments such as the “30 by 30” biodiversity target.


## Use of GitHub
This site is hosted using GitHub Pages to support transparency, collaboration, and rapid deployment. 
As the PAN-NZ standards and dataset catalogues are still in draft form, GitHub provides a collaborative 
environment where contributors can propose changes, raise issues, and suggest improvements through 
pull requests. It also allows data custodians and stakeholders to openly track discussions around protected 
area records, improving shared understanding and version control. While this is not a full-featured data catalogue, 
it represents a practical and scalable starting point within available resources—and crucially, it fosters 
collaboration across agencies and regions as the Protected Areas Network continues to evolve.

## Guidelines
As part of this initiative, guidelines have been developed to define the minimum requirements that
protected area datasets must meet to be included in the PAN-NZ national view of legal protections.

These guidelines can be found on the [guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/guidelines/index.html) page.


## Data catalogues
The data catalogues attempt to capture all protected area datasets held by central and local government as
well as other administering bodies such as not for profit organisations. The purpose of ths catalogues
is create a view of all protected area datasets and there status. 

These catalogues have several purposes:
* Under pin the efforts to aggregate the dataset into the national PAN-NZ product
* Identify datasets that currently cannot be included in PAN-NZ, and outline the steps 
  data holders need to take to make them eligible for inclusion.

## Document Purpose
The purpose of this document is two fold:

* To maintain a record of all known sources of Aotearoa New Zealand protected area datasets and their current state.

* To provide guidelines to data holders to support the inclusion of their data in the national 
Protected Areas Network of New Zealand (PAN-NZ).

The ultimate goal is to lift the quality, completeness, and accessibility of the PAN-NZ spatial 
dataset while supporting low-effort, frequent national data integration and publishing. -->
