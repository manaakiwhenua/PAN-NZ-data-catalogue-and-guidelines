<!-- ## Significant Natural Area Source Catalogue -->
This catalogue documents datasets relating to Significant Natural Areas (SNAs)
as identified under Section 6(c) of the Resource Management Act 1991, which
requires all territorial authorities to map and protect areas of significant
indigenous vegetation and significant habitats of indigenous fauna as a matter
of national importance.

While PAN-NZ is gathering protected area data sources more broadly, we are
recording known SNA datasets for visibility and coordination purposes. However,
we are not currently prioritising their inclusion in the national protected
areas layer. This is due to ongoing ambiguity resulting from recent RMA
legislative changes and the expectation of further updates to New Zealandâ€™s
resource management system.
